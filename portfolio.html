        Adoption Site
      </h1>
      <p>
        A project made for a university course about Java. The project includes
        technologies such as JSF, AJAX, JDBC. It is about building a site for adoption
        of pets using Java as Backend language and Glassfish as a server.
      </p>

      <p>
        The site enables users to register with an email and a password.
        After registering or login, the user can search for pets by category
        and area in Israel. He then can see all details about the pet, and about
        the user who offered this pet.
      </p>
      <p>
        The user can also offer a pet for adoption. He fills all details about
        it and choose communication methods
      </p>
      <p>
        The user can also change any details about an offer he has made. Of course
        he is able to notify that an offer is no longer relevant.

      <h1>
        Memory Game
      </h1>
      <p>
        A project for university assignment using Java networking. In this project
        a player connects to a server and ask to play. The server waits for another
        player to ask the same thing and then match those two players and start a game for them.
      </p>

      <p>
        The game presents each player a board table with NxN black cards. Each player
        on this own turn choose 2 cards. If they are the same color the cards are
        exposed and the player gets points for that. If the cards are not the same color
        they turn black again.
      </p>
      <p>
        In each action of the player, the game of that player connects to the server.
        The project uses TCP conneciton. Also uses threads that read messages from a queue
        and threads that write to a queue.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project is not final and under constructions. Still needs to deal with exceptions
        and game-finishing.
