      <h1> About Me </h1>
      <p>
        I live in Tel Aviv, Israel. I moved here just before COVID-19 started
        . Actually I preferred to live in Jerusalem where I had lived 4 years
        before. In These times I mostly study things related to Computer Science
         including Web Development and Data Analysis. And I look for a new
         career as a developer to express my experience and my knowledge and
         more important- my talent.
      </p>

      <h1>My Education</h1>
        <p>
          In high-school I learned Computer Science. I got very high grades (I
          got  honor roll from Ministry of Education). During studies I developed
           a site for commemorative of the Holocaust. The site got rewards from
           Hod-Ami company.
        </p>
        <p>
          I started by studying for B.A in Mathematics and Psychology, cause I
          wanted to become a teacher or a psychologist. Eventually I decided to
          give up both. I still like teaching. But I prefer doing it as independently.
           I discovered I can express more analytic capabilities and creativity
            through developing.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2017 I started studying 2 courses in the Open University. I really
          like this university. First of all because I can study in parallel with
          working in a bank. I took a course about Java and was very enthused to
          discover I am very good with it. Since then I take 2-3 courses and enjoy
           it. I’m not hurry to finish the degree in Computer Science since it is
            more important to me to find a student or a junior position.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2020 I took a big step forward and registered for a Bootcamp of Software
           Development in Experis Academy in order to study things which are not
           been taught in university. These are more practical concepts like working
            with Git and Linux and writing code which is compatible with industry
             needs. Code which is maintainable, robust, readable and put to use
             for other users. I studied C, C++, Operating Systems, OOP concepts,
              Design Patterns and Python. Although C++ is a very powerful language,
              Python was more exciting to me. Since the course ended I took an
              online course about Python in Udemy.

      <h1>My Job Experience</h1>
      <p>
        I was a teacher for Mathematics and Computer Science many years (not a
        formal one in class in front of students) either private or as assistant
        on high-schools or online.
      </p>
      <p>
        I worked 4 years in call service in foreign-currency department of the
         Postal Bank of Israel, Jerusalem. I got many friends there and the job
          was quite interesting.
